## How to use

For now, the only possible method is:

1. Download the project .zip file;
2. Take the folder containing the `statistic.py` file and place it in your project;
3. In the file you want to use the methods, import the folder and file and, if preferred, the methods you will use separately.

## More details

In this project there is a file with a more detailed explanation of what each method does. The file that has these explanations and details is the [`descriptions.md`](descriptions.md).

> Note: The `descriptions.md` file is ready. If there is any structure modification in the `statistic.py` file, the `descriptions.md` will be modified.
