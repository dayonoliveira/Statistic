# `continuous.py` module

## Introduction

This file is intended to clarify the functioning of each function of the `continuous.py` module, so that the developer can solve all your doubts. If you have read the document and still do not understand something or have encountered a problem, please open a new [issue](https://github.com/dayonoliveira/Statistic/issues) reporting the problem or question.

In each function you will have examples of how they work. The examples will be based on a data set taken from a list of exercises in the Quantitative Methods in Computing course, from the Computer Science course at Universidade de Fortaleza.
